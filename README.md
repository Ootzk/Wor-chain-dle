Wordle meets word chain — your next guess must start with the last letter of your previous one.

## How to Play

1. Guess the hidden 5-letter word in 6 tries.
2. After each guess, the color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word.
   - **Purple** — The letter is in the correct spot.
   - **Orange** — The letter is in the word but in the wrong spot.
   - **Gray** — The letter is not in the word.
3. A new word is available every day.

> **Chain rule (coming soon):** Starting from the second guess, your word must begin with the last letter of your previous guess.
