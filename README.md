**Wordle meets word chain** — guess the word while chaining letters in a snake pattern.

A new word every day at [ootzk.github.io/Wor-chain-dle](https://ootzk.github.io/Wor-chain-dle).

## How to Play

Guess the hidden 5-letter word in 6 tries. After each guess, tiles change color to show how close you were:

- **Green** — Correct letter, correct spot.
- **Purple** — Correct letter, wrong spot.
- **Gray** — Letter not in the word.

</p>

## The Chain Rule

Here's the twist. Starting from your **2nd guess**, a letter **chains** from your previous word. The chained letter is auto-filled and locked — you can't change it.

Your first guess is free. Let's say you start with **SHAKE**:

</p>

The last letter **E** chains down to your second guess. It's already locked in — your next word must end with that letter. You enter **LANCE**:

</p>

The chain alternates sides like a snake:

```
Guess 1 → 2:  last letter chains   (right side)
Guess 2 → 3:  first letter chains  (left side)
Guess 3 → 4:  last letter chains   (right side)
Guess 4 → 5:  first letter chains  (left side)
Guess 5 → 6:  last letter chains   (right side)
```

## Dead Ends

&#x26A0;&#xFE0F; Watch out — if the chained letter doesn't match the answer's position, the game ends early. Plan your guesses carefully!
